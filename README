iClass EEPROM Dumper (iclass_eeprom_dump)
 Using method described here:
  http://proxclone.com/pdfs/iClass_Key_Extraction.pdf

 A lot of code was borrowed from here:
  http://www.openpcd.org/git-view/iclass-security/tree/pic18-icsp/uMain.cpp

 According to
  http://www.ftdichip.com/Support/Documents/DataSheets/Cables/DS_TTL-232R_CABLES.pdf

 The FTDI TTL-232R-5V-WE pin out is:

                1 - Black
                2 - Brown
                3 - Red
                4 - Orange
                5 - Yellow
                6 - Green

 According to
  http://www.openpcd.org/images/HID-iCLASS-security.pdf

 The HID RW300/RW400 ICSP pin out is (on the back under the tape,
  starting from left to right, with the sticker on the bottom):

		1 - VSS
                2 - VDD
                3 - VPP/MCLR
                4 - PGD
                5 - PGC
                6 - PGM

 So our pin out will be:

        FTDI COLOR -> HID PIN -> HID ICSP
           Black   ->    1    ->    VSS
            Red    ->    2    ->    VDD
            N/A    ->    3    ->    VPP
           Green   ->    4    ->    PGD
           Orange  ->    5    ->    PGC
           Brown   ->    6    ->    PGM

 For VPP we'll use an external 9V battery, just connect
 the VCC (+) on the battery to the VPP location when prompted
 (helps to have a switch) and the GND (-) to VSS

 This uses the FTDI-D2XX drivers. Get them from
